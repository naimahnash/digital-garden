# Queerception

Queerception is a portmanteau for queer conception. Touches on various topics related to conceiving a child as a queer couple.

### Conception options

#### IUI

Intrauterine Insemination, this procedure is done by a medical professional. In combination with the procedure, you take stimulating drugs and carefully track the menstrual cycle to determine the best time to inseminate.

- sometimes covered by insurance, but out of pocket costs are about \$400 - 2000 per attempt, not including medicine costs.

#### ICI/IVI

Intracervical and Intravaginal can be used interchangeably. Can be performed at home, sperm is inserted into the vagina. Also known as the "turkey baster method"

- the cost, if performing at home, is just for the insemination kit and the sperm \(or if known donor, the cost of testing the sperm\).

#### IVF

In vitro fertilization

#### RIVF

Reciprocal in vitro fertilization, or Egg swap, as I call it, is when one partner carries the embryo from the other partner.
