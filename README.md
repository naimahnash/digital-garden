# Introduction

A [digital garden](digital-gardens/main.md) is a knowledge repository. In this one I will share various tidbits of knowledge that I have collected and further researched. Some of this will be in my own words, some will be notes. This will be available for both my own future reference as well as for anyone who stumbles on it.
